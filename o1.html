        <h2>We all bleed the same color</h2>
        <p>
          Last week, I was walking past a school and heard a kid say to his
          friend: "I don't understand how that is. We all bleed the same color.
          Why do people hate each other?" Simple words from a child, but it's
          amazing how few adults recognize this basic fact of life. We are all
          born with blood that is the same color, so why do we use it to hurt
          others? What if we used it to help one another instead?
        </p>
        <h3>
          It's a simple fact, but it's amazing how many people don't recognize
          it.
        </h3>
        <p>
          It's a simple fact, but it's amazing how many people don't recognize
          it. Our blood all has the same color—in fact, it's called "red"
          because of this. Every single one of us bleeds red when we get cut or
          injured, and our hearts pump red when they're beating. This means that
          the person in front of you at Starbucks has the same blood as you do;
          if someone were to slit his throat right now and bleed out on the
          floor while screaming in pain, his face would turn bright red just
          like yours would if that happened to you. The thing about blood is
          that we all have so much of it; it makes sense for us not to think
          about what happens when some gets spilled out onto our hands or
          clothes or into a cup at Starbucks (which is why this article exists).
          When I was younger I used to think about how horrifying it would be if
          somebody spilled their drink inside my backpack; now I know better
          than anyone else does how wrong my original perspective was!
        </p>
        <h3>We all bleed the same color.</h3>
        <p>
          We all bleed red. The color of our blood is not a marker of who we
          are, or what we’ve done. We are all the same; humans with red blood
          pumping through our veins. To think otherwise is to deny your own
          humanity and that of others—which is exactly what those who try to pit
          us against each other have been trying to do for centuries, in order
          to justify their own hatefulness and greed for power. We don't have
          different colored blood; it's just that some people let it show more
          than others.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Remember the blood in your body is the same as the blood in your
          neighbor or a stranger
        </h3>
        <p>
          All blood is red. All blood is the same red. All blood has the same
          color, the same makeup, and carries oxygen to all parts of your body
          that need it. As a human being, you have an obligation to keep your
          body healthy by making sure your blood stays clean and
          free-flowing—make an appointment with your doctor if you need help
          with that!
        </p>
        <p>
          Humans are not perfect, and neither is this world we live in, but it's
          important to remember that differences aside — whether it be race,
          religion or even political views — people are all the same. What makes
          us unique as individuals is what brings us together as a society. We
          should celebrate our differences and influence each other with our
          opposing views because without diversity, the world would be one dull
          place!
