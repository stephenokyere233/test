        <h2>Meeting the Challenge of Disruptive Change</h2>
        <p>
          The job of a leader is to look ahead. To anticipate better than others
          what's coming and plan accordingly. You've probably seen this
          principle in action. Maybe you even find yourself living by it. But
          the pace of change today means that people need new ways to help them
          keep up—and stay ahead. Helping others prepare for the future is a key
          part of the job for anyone in a leadership position, no matter what
          title you hold or how long you've been on the job. This process can be
          challenging, but it's not impossible if you're willing to approach
          things from a new vantage point—to flip your perspective upside down
          and inside out as often as necessary to see things as they really are,
          not as they seem to be at first glance.
        </p>
        <h3>Our lives and businesses are affected by disruptive change.</h3>
        <p>
          Your life and your business are affected by disruptive change.
          Technology is changing the way we live, work and communicate. This can
          be a challenge for us personally, but also a challenge for businesses
          as they try to adapt to new technologies that are affecting their
          customers' lives.
          <br />
          It's not just technology that has changed the way we do things -
          technologies like the internet have made it possible to communicate
          faster than ever before. In fact, this means that businesses need to
          be quick in order to stay ahead of competitors who are using
          technology at lightning speed (not literally) - meaning efficient use
          of resources is more important than ever before!
          <br />
          Disruption doesn't always mean negative consequences though: sometimes
          disruption is good for everyone involved in an industry because it
          leads innovation which could potentially improve quality of life for
          everyone involved including those working within any given field."

          The rules of the game are changing so fast sometimes it seems like

        </h3>
        <p>
          The rules of the game are changing so fast sometimes it seems like
          everyone is playing a new game. Technology is transforming how we do
          everything: business, communications, work and play—even learning and
          living. It is changing everything at breakneck speed.
          <br />
          The pace of change has accelerated dramatically over the past decade
          as technology has become more affordable and accessible to more people
          in more places. We have been able to do more with less time and money
          than ever before because our tools have become smarter and easier to
          use; they allow us to collaborate across distances; they make specific
          tasks easier by automating repetitive steps; they provide real-time
          feedback on our performance; they give us access to vast stores of
          information that can help us make better decisions faster; and so
          on...
        </p>

          Change is good, but it can be hard to embrace change in the face of
          uncertainty.
        </h3>
        <p>Change is good, but it can be hard to embrace change in the face of uncertainty.
        When a company experiences a disruptive change, it can be very difficult
        to figure out how that will affect their business. There are many reasons 
        why this is so:
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>
        Change is scary and uncertain. People don't like uncertainty because
        they don't know what's going to happen next or what will happen if 
        they make the wrong decision. They may feel overwhelmed by all the possibilities
          of what could happen, so they're not sure which direction would be best for them
          or their company.
        </li>
        <li>
        Change has risks associated with it—some risks are bigger than others depending on your
        particular situation; some risks could even threaten your entire business if not handled 
        correctly! As such, there's always some risk involved when implementing any kind of 
        process within an organization (such as introducing new technology).
          So while embracing change sounds like a good idea overall...it also comes with
          challenges that you needn't ignore!
        </li>

        <h3>The challenge for leaders is to learn how to improve their ability to deal with disruptive change.</h3>
        <p>The challenge for leaders is to learn how to improve their ability to deal with disruptive change.
        Leaders have a responsibility to plan for change and create it, but they also need the ability to respond
        effectively when things go wrong or unexpectedly.
        Leaders must be able to reframe problems by asking questions such as: "What are the implications?" "What would happen 
        if we tried something different?"</p>
        <p>
        When there is no precedent or obvious path forward, a leader's role is to 
        create a shared vision around what's possible and what's next.
        It’s not about following the vision. It’s about creating it together
          with your team—and then taking it on as your own.
        Leadership requires that you create a shared vision for your organization
        based on where you want to go as a company and how you will get there.
        This means that leaders need to be able to envision what the future could 
        look like, then communicate that vision clearly so everyone understands where they
        are headed and why they should join in helping make it happen.
        Successful leaders believe they have a responsibility not only to plan for 
        change but also, more important, to create it.
        If you don't know where you're going, any road will take you there. In a dynamic world 
        of continuous change, leaders need to be able to create a shared vision for their organizations and
        make it happen. The process of doing so requires that leaders engage their people in setting priorities;
          prioritize key initiatives; empower others—including employees at all levels—to act on those priorities; 
          communicate progress regularly and often (clearly communicating failures as well as successes); and monitor 
          progress toward outcomes or results that are meaningful to the business.
        If you believe this is easy or straightforward, consider how many times your organization has had a clearly
        articulated strategy only to see it become muddled when various departments began working at cross purposes 
        within months after its adoption by senior management!
        Being a leader means being able to look at things in new ways and find solutions that help others succeed too.
        To be a leader, you need to step outside the box and look at things differently. You have to ask yourself, 
        "What's the best way to get this done?" rather than just thinking about how things have been done in the past.
        You also need to create an environment where everyone can thrive: not just your direct reports but also those 
        around them who report up through their managers as well as other employees who are cross-trained in different
        areas but support each other. The people who work with us and partner with us every day are our most valuable
          resources, so we want them all focused on their highest potentials—and that means having their backs no matter
          what happens! We want our team members feeling like they're part of something bigger than themselves; it's very
            important for us that they feel like they're making a difference by being part of our team or project teams here 
            at [COMPANY]</p>
        We are living in a time of unprecedented change. To be successful, we must embrace the challenge posed by this disruptive
        change and find the opportunities that disruption creates. The key to embracing the changes is to reframe our perspective. Great leaders find ways to see problems from new angles and create shared visions around what's possible and what's next. In a world where disruption is so common, being able to embrace change is essential for success.
