       <h2>Reclaim Your Creative Confidence</h2>
        <p> 
        <i>Creativity</i>  is not a question of talent; it's a mindset. There is no
          “creative type”; we are all unique and inventive in our own ways. But
          in order to achieve peak creativity, we must first confront our inner
          critics and develop a beginner's mentality. Creativity isn't easy, but
          with these tips, you can conquer your doubts and start creating today!
        </p>

        <p><h3>Creativity is not a question of talent; it’s a mindset.</h3>
          Creativity is not a question of talent, it's a mindset. Creative
          confidence is a way of thinking and approaching problems. It’s not
          just about being able to make things, but being able to look at the
          world in unconventional ways and asking questions that no one has
          asked before. It’s all about trying new things and maybe failing, but
          learning from those mistakes until you succeed—which will happen
          eventually if you’re persistent enough (and you should be). Being
          creative means doing research on what other people have done before,
          so that you know where your ideas fit into the bigger picture (or
          don't fit).
        </p>
        
        <p><h3>The only way to get creative is to do creative work.</h3>
          Creativity is a skill, and like any skill it can be learned. Creative
          confidence is not a talent. It's not about being born with the
          creative gene, but rather about developing your creative muscles and
          becoming more comfortable using them on a regular basis. Creativity
          isn't just about making things, but also learning new things—it's an
          iterative process of experimentation, failure and growth.
        </p>

        <p>        <h3>Know that there’s no such thing as a “creative type”.</h3>
          Don’t limit yourself to a particular type of creative work. Don’t be
          afraid to try new things, even if they don’t feel like the “right
          fit”. And don’t be afraid to fail; it just means you have more
          experience under your belt!
        </p>
        
        <p><h3>
          Don’t let your inner critics stop you from creating.</h3>
          <ul>
          <li>Don’t let your inner critic stop you from trying.</li>
          <li>Don’t let your inner critic stop you from learning.</li>
        <li>Don’t let your inner critic stop you from doing.</li>
          <li>Don’t let your inner critic stop you from being and connecting with
          other people in the world who might be able to help you become the
          best version of yourself that you can be!</li> 
          </ul>
      
          
        </p>
        
        <p><h3>Make your mark.</h3>
          A desire to make a mark on the world is one of the most common reasons
          people think about leaving their jobs. They want to do something that
          matters, be known for something and feel proud of themselves in the
          present tense.
        </p>
        
        <p><h3>Embrace the “beginner’s mindset”.</h3>
          Be open to new ideas and ways of thinking. Be willing to try new
          things. Be willing to learn from your mistakes, even if it means that
          you have to do something differently than you’re used to doing it or
          with a different process than the one that has worked for you in the
          past. Ask others for help and feedback—and accept their honest
          responses without judgement or ego-based defensiveness, regardless of
          what they might say about how your work looks or sounds. Take risks on
          projects that inspire you—even if they feel risky at first! Consider
          what happens when we don’t take risks: life becomes boring,
          stagnant...and unfulfilling as well as uninspiring if we stay inside
          our comfort zones forever (which I promise will happen). If we never
          take a risk in life then why bother being alive at all? What fun is
          that?! It’s better than dying young though so please do try not too
          die!
        </p>
        
        <p><h3>
          Expose yourself to new experiences, new ideas, and new people in order
          to spark inspiration.
        </h3>
          Once you've created a safe space for yourself to play and explore, the
          next step is to expose yourself to new experiences. As I mentioned
          earlier, creativity thrives on inspiration. The more you expose
          yourself to new things (and people), the more likely you'll be able to
          find inspiration in them. The world is filled with amazing things—you
          just have to be willing and open enough to see them all. Be
          open-minded; try something new; be brave! Think about how much fun it
          is when we allow ourselves time and space for creativity in our lives
          by going on vacation or going out with friends on weekends. Why not
          bring that same energy into our everyday lives? If we want our
          creative confidence back, we need to start looking at all aspects of
          life as opportunities for creative expression instead of restrictions
          on what we can do or think about doing creatively: exposing ourselves
          daily gives us access every day rather than waiting until something
          "exciting" happens before taking action."
        </p>
        
        <p><h3>You may have creative confidence and not even know it!</h3>
          You may already have creative confidence, and don’t even know it!
          Creative confidence is a mindset. It’s not about talent or natural
          ability—it’s about doing creative work and learning from your
          mistakes. Creative confidence comes from research, trying new things,
          making mistakes (and loving them), getting feedback, and finding your
          own style.
